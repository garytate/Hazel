[04:22:30] [MEC] Lilith 'Baghead' Weaver: offers one final nod and a tight hug as a friendly gesture, a display of her excitement and hope, nearly crumpling the paper bag against his back if it weren't for some quick thinking, holding the hand that held it slightly offset from his body before drawing both arms back, fastening the aforementioned back onto her face with some minor adjustments to it's placement so her eyes could see clearly once again. "Back to normal for a second- Please do have my back when I got to tell Hermit to, well, buzz off- Feeling like they're gonna pull some fiesty shit-"
[04:23:32] [ME] John 'Blackling' Davis: dives into bag once again, taking his hand out with some chips and keeping them open on their palm as they use their other hand to locate them in their mouth, enjoying their taste.

They mumble out a muted "...Mind 'y bag-", before she'd have moved her hand away, his speech stopped as she notices and does so. They nod towards the increasingly crumpled mask donned about her visage. "...Might need to invest in a new one of those things, 'Lil. The poor thing's starting to look more like a burn victim by the day-- And, don't worry. If they start shit I'll just kick 'em in the teeth.

[05:17:15] [W] Lilith 'Baghead' Weaver: So- Regarding Hermit, the current consensus is that we'll be leaving her to guard this place if she wishes, just like she did before, but as we're all sort of expecting her to act out at that, well- Either we'll have to simply strip her of all her authority and make her just another visitor here, or ask her to leave- I don't want to do any of those last two things, but I will if I have to- A strong stance against it rather than just letting her continue to annoy people around here is what we need- At least, that last part I personally believe, can't say the same for the others-

[05:20:59] [W] Lilith 'Baghead' Weaver: What do you think personally, Doc? I was thinking of the same, till I heard she'd already been stripped of her rank as Guard once before for beating an Old man for disobeying her and using him as an example to the others as to why they should 'always listen' or some funky shit-", she lowers both hands down to her side as she spoke, gloved fingers tapping at her trousers idly, "It's a tough choice to make, for sure- It doesn't help she's been comin' onto me either, doesn't seem to bother her than I'm not into women she still keeps on about it-

[05:53:29] [LOOC] Charles Wyatt: if you think that's how it should go, ok. im not even bandwagoning i just dislike removing people who i play w/ on the reg for something that wasn't racist. it's a blatant rulebreak and a word that shouldn't be used but it's not

[05:57:38] [LOOC] Charles Wyatt: okay a ban sure but come on, perma just removes a group of people from the equation. i don't like bandwagoning and im not with them cause 'they're my friends' it's just that at this point you lose a lot of players who provide value to the server by merely being part of the passive group
[05:57:52] [LOOC] Charles Wyatt: the rules exist to be enforced at the whim of the admin who sees the rulebreak and the player should respect that
[05:58:14] [LOOC] Charles Wyatt: :(
[05:59:04] [LOOC] Charles Wyatt: sure man, if that's what you wanna see it at. i'm just appealing to see it at the eye-level of the effects. i don't like group-think or 'ill leave cause my friend got banned' cause i deal with it but, alright
