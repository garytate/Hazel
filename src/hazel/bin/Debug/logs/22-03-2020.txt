He presumed the accumulation was from.. some odd individuals who can somehow miss the bin by this far, or, by simple overflowing tips. Either way, he did his job- loading his arms up with what he could and dumping it into the green dirty trash can bit by bit. He'd probably go clean his hands after.. but the grime never really comes out. He tries to avoid sharp objects, but can't help but prick his rough hands on a few objects as he firmly hauled them upwards.

Slowly and steadily, he digs his knife under the paddings, cutting through anything keeping them together, be it glue or sewage. When he was done, he removes any excess padding strips that may still reside on the pants and takes a step back as he inspects them. Satisfied with the result, he puts them back on. "Fucking cops."
