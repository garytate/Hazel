[14:23:22] [W] Julianne 'Jill' Victoria: You don't go off, sort yourself out 'n' it's not enough. You either do a Charlotte 'n' screw someone, which in-turn gets me pissy 'n' we get a repeat from scenario A. Or I don't find out, 'n'.. well, that's not a fun scenario.
[14:23:42] [W] Julianne 'Jill' Victoria: You don't go off 'n' sort yourself out, it's enough. But you're the one at a disadvantage 'n' uncomfortable. That's not fair on you.
[14:24:50] [W] Julianne 'Jill' Victoria: We can screw, I'm sure we'd have fun but our core principle is broke. I don't date people, so we'd still be friends.
