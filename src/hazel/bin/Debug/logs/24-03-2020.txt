"Well, this week Five and me went into that DB over there, uh... DB-5, I think. There's a vent and a second roof pretty much, and I asked if we could go up there. We cracked the vent, and Five gave me a boost up." He stopped there, taking his arm back. "I looked towards the clearly empty vent, and said all sorts of things." Then, he needed to chuckle, and smiled. His hands started to fiddle in the air infront of him, as he went on. "Five! Look! We found cocaine! And RPGs! And what's that? Sooo many strippers are there! You won't believe it!"

When satisfied, the officer turns his stunstick off and clips it back onto their belt, taking out an utility knife. He kneels and positions the blade between her wrists, cutting her ties.

It remains that way for a few seconds, before they previously mentioned 'tendrils' retract back into the floating orb, his wounds healed, leaving a tingling sensation. After all that is said and done, the orb slowly floats back towards Chela, and into their right-shoulder, effectively absorbing it. Atleast, that's what it seems to do. It just vanishes once out of eyesight, effectively.
