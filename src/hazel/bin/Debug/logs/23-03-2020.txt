[21:47:24] [IT] Alexis Kreuz: The movie reveals a little bit of truth here and there to the viewer, dropping hints in dialogue between the Commanding Officer talking to eachother, enemies and friends alike - the whole war is fake and serves solely for entertainment. It keeps peoples' mind off of the true issues, that their leaders only try to fatten themselves. But most of it was skipped by some unattentive eyes - the ending is about killing a man who tried to end this vicious cycle and the general bringing his life to an end gets promoted to traitor - keeping the cycle alive - as long as humanity keeps going like this there is no hope for them. The end.
