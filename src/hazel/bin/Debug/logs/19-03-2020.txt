[03:32:51] [IT] Hadrian O'Herron: The Figure waits for the creature to finish contemplating it's next move.
[03:32:58] [LOOC] 'Zero': you'll be forced to interact with simulants, many of whom will appear indistinguishable from normal people
[03:33:04] [LOOC] 'Zero': in both appearance and mannerisms
[03:33:24] [LOOC] 'Zero': you'll also frequently bear witness to simulant abilities, i.e their strength, speed, etc
[03:33:30] [ME] 'Ed': doesn't react to the light at all, instead flailing its claws at the man, letting out another monstrous growl. The claw misses the man by inches, as the zombie stumbles cloer.
[03:33:33] [LOOC] 'Ed': closer*
[03:33:38] [LOOC] 'Zero': just shit to show how much "better" they are
[03:33:53] [LOOC] Lee Faulkner: q: how is this gonna work in rp
[03:33:59] [LOOC] Lee Faulkner: like once he does finally break
[03:34:05] [LOOC] 'Zero': bring you back as a simulant
[03:34:21] [LOOC] 'Zero': normally i'd keep them event only but i'll just have lee go back to the ELA and begin to subver them
[03:34:27] [LOOC] 'Zero': subvert*
[03:34:51] [LOOC] 'Zero': cripple the INFRASTRUCTURE, not the people, so that they won't be able to fight when the war happens and instead have no choice but to listen to zero
[03:35:03] [ME] Hadrian O'Herron: leans left and right, the improbably long claws scarcely missing. He throws a leg out into the shins of the WasMan, sending it into the water at it's side.
[03:35:04] Hadrian O'Herron rolled 96 out of 100.
[03:35:04] Hadrian O'Herron used command '/Roll'.
[03:35:13] [LOOC] Lee Faulkner: understood!
[03:35:17] [LOOC] 'Zero': u get what i'm sayin? real psy-ops shit
[03:35:22] [LOOC] 'Zero': but it's up to you what happens to lee
[03:35:45] 'Ed' rolled 25 out of 100.
[03:35:45] 'Ed' used command '/Roll'.
[03:35:53] [LOOC] Lee Faulkner: i'd like to keep him as a character of course, probably could have some psi-tech shit done eventually so he's not some ultra-powerful stimulant always
[03:36:20] [ME] 'Ed': lets out another, even louder roar, as it gets kicked in the shin. It stumbles down into the sewer, flailing its arms violently.
[03:36:22] [LOOC] 'Zero': idk how i feel about the process being reversed
[03:36:23] [IT] Hadrian O'Herron: The zombie topples over, falling into the murky wastewater as a result. The Figure continues onwards, briefcase in hand.
[03:36:31] [LOOC] 'Zero': tissues and such are like fundamentally modified
[03:36:40] [LOOC] Lee Faulkner: yeah but the problem is 
[03:36:50] [LOOC] Lee Faulkner: how's lee supposed to stay a normal character without people bitching?
[03:37:00] [LOOC] 'Zero': he might not be able to
[03:37:05] [LOOC] 'Zero': therein lies the rub about this event series
[03:37:26] [ME] Eleanor 'Rigby' Davis: sets herself on the bed, sighing and rubbing the fabric. "Right, okay... Goodnight, Vurr."
[03:37:27] [ME] 'Ed': continues flailing in the water, slamming its claws on the concrete, clumsily and slowly stumbling out.
[03:37:32] [LOOC] 'Zero': anyone who joins the angels can't become a normal character again. they'd either have to die at some point during the series or otherwise be rendered unplayable
[03:37:33] 'Ed' used command '/ActSleep'.

Lua then came to detach absolutely everything, remove the IV kits, the different tubes and others from his body before approaching and injecting him again in an IV kit of Edrophonium to awaken the man little by little. What he saw when he woke up was his body, bare chest, with underpants on, his legs still bare and his left arm. He would probably have difficulty getting up for the first time, moving his limbs. But he could feel everything, as if it were another body, as if his nerves were active.

[21:53:41] [ME] Cartier 'Carti' Johnson: lays out eight separate pieces of scrap metal on the workbench, alongside two pieces of paper and a medium-sized chunk of charcoal. He'd use the tools at his disposition within the workbench to form what looks like a primitive empty charcoal-filter shell. He'd examine in carefully, sealing and repairing any structural errors there'd be. A little carving is left out in a specific manner - it allows for a lid to pop open and closed. Carti then takes the piece of charcoal and positions it in its designated area within the filter, closing it thereafter.
